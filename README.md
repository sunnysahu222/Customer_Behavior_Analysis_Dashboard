# Customer_Behavior_Analysis_Dashboard
customer behavior analysis dashboard using python mysql and python and power bi
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, including loading data in Python, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), cleaning data, running SQL queries, building an interactive Power BI dashboard, generating insights, and preparing a final report and presentation.

The main goal is to showcase strong analytical, technical, and reporting skills using modern data tools.
